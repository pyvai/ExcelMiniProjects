# ExcelMiniProjects

🎯A collection of Excel mini projects built during my learning journey. These projects focus on solving real-world problems using Excel’s powerful tools, including formulas, charts, pivot tables, and automation features. From interactive dashboards and student performance trackers to summary reports and data visualizations, each project reflects a hands-on approach to learning and applying data analysis concepts.

As I continue to grow and explore new Excel features and use cases, I will keep expanding this repository with more practical and well-structured projects. Whether it's for educational use, process improvement, or data insights, these projects are small steps toward mastering data with simplicity and creativity
